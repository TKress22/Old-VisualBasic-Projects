# Old-VisualBasic-Projects
A collection of some of my old Visual Basic projects that were a semblance of decency.
Many of these were worked on during my high school days.
All of these projects were something I took the basic requirements and went a few steps beyond to add extra features.

A brief description of each:

## ClickCon
Likely my proudest work in Visual Basic so far, a simple board game that started as a spin-off experiment project, and has since been moved to a JavaScript webpage version instead.

## Frogga
A high school version rip off of the classic arcade game "Frogger", using minimalistic art.

## Movie Rental
A simple UI to rent movies in.

## PizzaCalc
A simple ish screen for ordering pizza. I decided it would also be fun to have the transaction log save to a text file.

## Screeeeensavers
When my teacher asked us to make a simple screen saver with one box bouncing around the screen, I simply wasn't satisfied, and proceeded to make an adjustable amount of boxes, with random colours, bounce around the screen instead, colliding with each other.

## Triangles
A project designed to classify what type a triangle is based on entering the lengths of each side. I decided to take it a bit further and also draw a version of what the triangle might look like.

## Yahtzee
One of the final projects for my programming class senior year. Our task was to make a basic Yahtzee game, and I got carried away adding a lot of other features, such as animated dice rolling, different art styles, and a few other UI tweaks.
